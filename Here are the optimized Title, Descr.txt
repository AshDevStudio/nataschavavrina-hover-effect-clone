💡 Tips to Rank Higher
Source Code Link: In the description where I wrote [INSERT YOUR GITHUB/PROJECT LINK HERE], paste the direct link to your GitHub repository or a code snippet (like CodePen/SandBox). YouTube algorithm loves external links that provide value.

Pinned Comment: Post a comment on your own video saying: "Source code is in the description! 👇 Let me know what website I should recreate next?" and Pin it. This boosts engagement.

Audio: Use a trending "Phonk" or "Lo-fi Coding" sound from the YouTube audio library to increase retention.

Text Overlay: In the first 3 seconds of the video, add text on screen saying "Awwwards Website vs. My React Code" to hook viewers immediately.
